1.3.2dev
--------

- Add 'help_as_title' to label properties to render help text as title of the

-----

- Label property can be callable.
  [rnix, 2012-02-19]

1.3

- Loading resources is done more explicit and in a pluggable way
  using entry-points. Thus yafowil extensions such as widgets
  can define an entry point. 
  [jensens, 2012-02-14]

  [jensens, 2012-01-20]

  [rnix, 2011-12-18]

  [rnix, 2011-12-18]

- ``checked`` attribute can be set explicitly in ``checkbox`` blueprint.
  [rnix, 2011-11-21]

- Add ``lines`` blueprint. Renders a textarea and extracts lines as list.
  [rnix, 2011-11-11]

- Added concept of *plans* to the factory, which is a named set of blueprints.
  Plans are registered to the factory and can be addressed with the ``#`` sign.
  [jensens, 2011-09-29]

- ``td`` blueprint can be used as compound or part of leaf widget now.
  [rnix, 2011-09-28]

- Accept value property on compounds.
  [rnix, 2011-09-27]

- Make ``data.extracted`` available as ``odict`` with values of children on
  compounds.
  [rnix, 2011-09-27]

- Pass ``blueprints`` and ``custom`` arguments to Widget constructor in factory
  for debugging and duplication purposes.
  [rnix, 2011-09-26]

- Rename ``yafowil.base.Widget._properties`` to
  ``yafowil.base.Widget.properties``.
  [rnix, 2011-09-26]

  compound and leaf widgets.

1.1.2
-----

- traceback supplement is now better formatted.
  [jensens, 2011-08-30]

1.1.1
-----

- Bugfix: mode ``display`` did eat up all previous renderings. This made error
  widget fail in display mode to show the value. Fixed: empty_display_renderer
  proxies now all previous rendered.
  [jensens, 2011-08-11]

1.1
---

- Extend select widget for better UI control of selections and multi selections
  [rnix, 2011-08-05]

- Plumb ``node.parts.Order`` to widget node
  [rnix, 2011-07-28]

- define label and field renderer as display renderer as well
  [rnix, 2011-07-25]

- deprecate use of mode widget
  [rnix, 2011-07-08]

- now mode is a central element: each Widget instance has a mode now: edit,
  display or skip. edit is default and works as usal. Display renders the new
  display_renderer chain. Skip just renders an empty Unicode string.

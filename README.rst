**Yet Another Form WIdget Library**.

YAFOWIL offers html-form creation and modification at runtime. Its light-weight
and provides an extensible, reusable set of blueprints to build flexible forms.

YAFOWIL is independent from any web-framework, but easy to use in your
web-framework.

It's all just about rendering widgets and extracting the data returned from the
browser per widget. It does not fight with storage.

YAFOWIL vary from most other HTML form packages: Its all just configuration. No
subclassing needed any more; no specific schema-framework is necessary.

Yafowil provides a factory where you can fetch your widgets instances from.
Or you register your own.
